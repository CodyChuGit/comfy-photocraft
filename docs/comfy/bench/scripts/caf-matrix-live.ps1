# Live: which removal instruction works on the 2511 fill (PhotoshopEX, 2026-10-21), on the
# lighthouse's red boat (final-fill-s11.png, rect 300,600 200x120), Lightning 8 (Quality balanced):
#   A  pixels kept, a generic "remove the object in the selected area" instruction
#   B  the mask-guided template (image 2 = the mask), pixels kept
#   C  pixels kept, the object named ("the red boat"): the ceiling a VLM naming step could reach
#   D  the hole flat grey (erase), the REMOVE_PROMPT wording
#   E  the guided template with the hole grey
#   F  the hole filled with the median colour of the surroundings is not here (needs code)
# Output: bench\caf-m-*.png and the timings.
