# Overnight 2026-10-27 Q3: the worker's chat with and without the key/value cache. For each CLI
# build (-Old: before genai-native's KvCache, -New: with it): the removal rewriter's question on
# the twenty naming-probe pictures (`naming-base`, seed 7: the answers must match word for word)
# and chat-smoke.ps1's three rewrites (a 120-token image prompt among them), with the worker's
# own chat timings (`chat` lines: tokens, prefill_s, chat_s).
